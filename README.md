# Bison and Flex Compiler
## A simple lexing and parser using Bison and Flex for grammar.
This project is built in order to show a simple example of how you can make a lexing and a parser using Bison and Flex.
What is expected the code of this project should do given an expression as an input:
1. Show a table of chunks of the expression with its associated token.
2. Check if an expression matches or not the grammar.
3. Show the derivative tree associated with the expression.
